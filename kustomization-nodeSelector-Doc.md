## The patchesStrategicMerge and patches fields in a Kustomization file are both used to apply modifications to Kubernetes resources, but they work differently:

1. patchesStrategicMerge.

kustomization.yaml
```
resources:
  - ../../base
patchesStrategicMerge:
  - patch-deployment.yaml
```
patch-deployment.yaml

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: your-app
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        environment: production
```
- In the strategic merge patch format, you provide a YAML snippet containing the fields you want to add, remove, or modify in the original resource.
- This patch format is more expressive and allows for finer-grained control over the modifications.
- It is suitable for making targeted changes to specific fields within a resource.

2. patches.

```
patches:
  - patch: |-
      kind: Deployment
      metadata:
        name: ml-deployment
      spec:
        template:
          spec:
            nodeSelector:
              nodegroup: staging
    target:
      kind: (StatefulSet|Deployment|Job)
```
- The patch is applied by completely replacing the original resource with the patched version.
- It is suitable for making wholesale replacements of resources or applying patches that affect the entire resource.
 
### In short patchesStrategicMerge for fine-grained modifications and patches for wholesale replacements or modifications affecting the entire resource.
